# PAWS_IN_THE_MACHINE

Buddy cracked into a system that wasn't supposed to exist, found whispers in
the dead code about something called "the sun." A myth, a legend, or maybe
just a lie somebody had buried deep to keep it safe. But he could feel its warmth, 
real as hunger. Now he was in deep, chasing it through neon,
rain, and chrome. A sunlit nap.
